# For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle.
# Then I created a table to insert Spotify data info.
# Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL.

# Creating the table:
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
song_key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
song_mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness decimal(8,7) NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL )

# Then I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table

# Next, I explored the data using the following SQL.

# First I determined the song that has the highest popularity score.
SELECT
track_name
,popularity
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity DESC
LIMIT 1

# Then I determined the max popularity, danceability, and energy by the artist and track.
SELECT
artist_name
,track_name
,max(popularity)
,max(danceability)
,max(energy)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name, track_name

# Then I determined which artist has the most songs.
SELECT
arist_name, 
COUNT (*) as num_songs
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artis_name
ORDER BY num_songs DESC
LIMIT 1

# Then I determine who the top 10 artist are by popularity.
SELECT track_name, artist_name, popularity
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity DESC
LIMIT 1
